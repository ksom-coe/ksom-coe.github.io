      <h3>1.1. Introduction to the Integrated MSc-PhD Programme</h3>
      <p>The Integrated MSc-PhD programme in Mathematics is an advanced training program at the postgraduate level leading to doctoral studies. The coursework is very flexible with a focus on grooming students for a research career in Mathematics. Depending on the choice of the electives, a student also has the option to choose a research career in Physics or Theoretical Computer Science as well. The curriculum is among the best that is available in the country at the postgraduate level. The Board of Studies for the Integrated MSc-PhD programme will supervise the programme.</p>

      <h3>1.2. Duration of the programme</h3>
      <p>The duration of the integrated programme will be 5 years. This includes 2 years of MSc coursework and 3 years of PhD coursework and research. The students are expected to complete the programme within 7 years.</p>

      <h3>1.3. Intake</h3>
      <p>The number of students admitted to the programme will be 10.</p>

      <h3>1.4. Eligibility</h3>
      <p>Candidates with a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics or an allied subject with at least 60% marks or equivalent grade from a recognized university are eligible to apply.</p>

      <h3>1.5. Admission Procedure</h3>
      <p>Admission will be based on a written test followed by an interview.</p>

      <h3>1.6. Fellowships</h3>
      <p>All admitted students will receive a monthly fellowship of Rs. 16,000 for the first two years (MSc component) and Rs. 31,000 for the subsequent years (PhD component), subject to satisfactory academic performance.</p>

        <h3>2.1. Credits</h3>
        <p>A total of 76 credits in two years is required to obtain the MSc. degree. Every student has to take the three bridge courses before the commencement of the first semester. The purpose of these bridge courses is to review the fundamentals from a typical undergraduate mathematics programme and to bridge any gaps in the foundations. The bridge course will be undertaken in the first month of the programme.</p>

        <h3>2.2. Core Courses (MSc)</h3>
        <p>There will be 8 core courses which contribute to 32 credits of the programme. The number of credits allocated to core and elective courses is equal to the number of contact hours every week including tutorial sessions in that particular course.</p>

        <h3>2.3. Elective Courses (MSc)</h3>
        <p>The elective courses for the third and fourth semesters offered at KSoM are listed in subsection 4.3. All the courses listed there may, however, not be offered in an academic year. The list of courses offered every year will be announced at the beginning of the third semester. Elective courses in the third semester will be categorized into blocks: Algebra block, Analysis block, and Geometry block. Every student is recommended to credit at least one course from each block. Elective-4 in the third semester is expected to be a first step towards the project/reading course in the final semester.</p>

        <h3>2.4. Research Project (MSc)</h3>
        <p>Every student has the option to work on a project or a reading course in the fourth semester. The project will comprise a dissertation and Viva at the end of the fourth semester. The project will carry 8 credits. Every student has the option of taking an elective and a reading course of 4 credits in the fourth semester, instead of a project. The reading course involves the study of an advanced topic or a research paper, along with a colloquium at the end of the programme.</p>

        <h3>2.5. Promotion to PhD Component</h3>
        <p>A student may continue into the PhD programme subject to the the following conditions:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The student has acquired 76 credits at the end the fourth semester.</li>
          <li>The CGPA of the student is at least 8 (in case of SC/ST candidates the cut-off shall be 7).</li>
          <li>The student has not obtained a grade of B or C in more than four courses during the MSc coursework.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>2.6. PhD Admission Limitations</h3>
        <p>The admission to the PhD component will be limited based on the availability of the research supervisors.</p>

        <h3>2.7. MSc Course Structure Summary</h3>
        <p>The course structure for the MSc is listed below. The detailed syllabi for the courses offered at KSoM are listed in subsections 4.2 and 4.3.</p>

        <h3>3.2. Grading System</h3>
        <p>Evaluation will be based on seven letter grades (<b>O</b>, <b>A+</b>, <b>A</b>, <b>B+</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b> and <b>F</b>) with numerical values (grade points) of 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5 and 0 respectively. In addition to the above, an incomplete grade given by <b>I</b> and an absent grade given by <b>Ab</b> will also be used. The grading scheme involved in any course at KSoM is absolute.</p>
        
        <h3>3.3. Continuous Assessment Components</h3>
        <p>The continuous assessment for the courses offered at KSoM will be based on a predetermined transparent system involving the following components :</p>

        <h3>3.5. Make-up Examination and CGPA Calculation</h3>
        <p>A student securing the grade 'F' in the respective course will be treated as having failed in the course. In such a scenario an option of a make-up examination will be provided. The make-up examination will be held in the week before the beginning of the next semester. The Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) out of $10$ is calculated as per the following formula</p>
        $$ \text{CGPA} = \frac{\sum_{\text{Courses taken in the programme}} \left(\text{No. of credits of the course} \times \text{Grade Points}\right)}{\text{Net total number of credits obtained in the core and elective courses}} $$
        <p>Courses taken in the programme does not include bridge courses. A semester grade point average (SGPA) is calculated similarly every semester.</p>
        
        <h3>3.6. MSc Degree Requirement</h3>
        <p>A student who has obtained 76 credits at the end of the second year, irrespective of satisfying the eligibility criterion for promotion into PhD, will be given an MSc degree.</p>
        
        <h3>3.7. Time Limit for MSc Completion and Promotion</h3>
        <p>The maximum time for completion of the MSc is 4 years during which 76 credits should be acquired. A student needs to acquire a minimum of 20 credits (excluding Viva) to get promoted to the second year of the programme. Any student unable to do so in the first two years will be asked to discontinue the MSc. programme.</p>

        <h3>5.1. Eligibility and Constitution of Doctoral Committee</h3>
        <p>The promotion of a student to the PhD component is subject to satisfying all conditions listed in 2.5, and on joining a research supervisor at the end of the second year. A doctoral committee will be constituted for each student on promotion to the PhD component. The doctoral committee will conduct the Oral General Comprehensive Examination (OGCE) in the fourth year of the student. The syllabus for the OGCE (four advanced courses in the area of specialization) will be designed by the research supervisor and approved by the doctoral committee.</p>

        <h3>5.2. Senior Research Fellowship</h3>
        <p>A student is promoted to Senior Research Fellowship on clearing the OGCE.</p>

        <h3>5.3. Progress Monitoring</h3>
        <p>The doctoral committee will monitor the yearly progress of the respective student at the end of each year thereafter.</p>
