### 1. GENERAL INFORMATION

#### 1.1. Kerala School of Mathematics.
[cite_start]Kerala school of Mathematics (KSOM) - a joint initiative of the Kerala State Council for Science, Technology and Environment, Government of Kerala and the Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India - is a national institute for advanced research in Mathematics. [cite: 210] [cite_start]KSOM was founded with the vision of establishing a centre of excellence for research in Mathematics. [cite: 211] [cite_start]The institute is a meeting ground for leading mathematicians from across the world and a centre of advanced learning in Mathematics in the state of Kerala. [cite: 212]

#### 1.2. The programme.
[cite_start]The Integrated MSc-PhD programme in Mathematics at KSOM is an advanced training program at the postgraduate level leading to doctoral studies. [cite: 213] [cite_start]The coursework is very flexible with a focus on grooming students for a research career in Mathematics. [cite: 214] [cite_start]Depending on the choice of the electives, a student also has the option to choose a research career in Physics or Theoretical Computer Science as well. [cite: 215] [cite_start]The curriculum is among the best that is available in the country at the postgraduate level. [cite: 216] [cite_start]The Board of Studies for the Integrated MSc-PhD programme of KSOM will supervise the Integrated MSc-PhD programme. [cite: 217]

#### 1.3. Admission.
[cite_start]The admission for the Integrated MSc-PhD programme at KSOM will be based on the national level entrance examination conducted by CMI/NBHM/KSOM. [cite: 218] [cite_start]Shortlisted candidates will be called for a test/interview thereafter at KSOM. [cite: 219] [cite_start]The minimum qualification required for joining the Integrated MSc-PhD programme is B.Sc., B.Math., B.Stat., BE / B.Tech. or an equivalent degree with Mathematics as one of the subjects. [cite: 220, 221]

#### 1.4. Duration.
[cite_start]The duration of the Integrated MSc-PhD programme shall be a minimum of ten semesters and a maximum of sixteen semesters. [cite: 222] [cite_start]The first four semesters are dedicated to the master's level coursework and the remaining towards doctoral studies leading to a PhD. [cite: 223] [cite_start]An academic year has two semesters, one from July/August to November and the other from January to May. [cite: 224] [cite_start]There will be a break between two semesters. [cite: 225]

#### 1.5. Scholarship.
The students selected for the Integrated MSc-PhD programme are entitled for a scholarship. The scholarship amount is currently Rs. [cite_start]6000 during the MSc coursework for a maximum period of four semesters. [cite: 226] [cite_start]However, a student who does not secure at least 24 credits (excluding Viva) in the first year forfeits her/his scholarship. [cite: 227] [cite_start]The scholarship during PhD will be at par with NBHM PhD scholarship. [cite: 228]

### 2. COURSE STRUCTURE

[cite_start]**2.1.** A total of 76 credits in two years is required to obtain the MSc. degree. [cite: 229] [cite_start]Every student has to take the three bridge courses before the commencement of the first semester. [cite: 230] [cite_start]The purpose of these bridge courses is to review the fundamentals from a typical undergraduate mathematics programme and to bridge any gaps in the foundations. [cite: 231] [cite_start]The bridge course will be undertaken in the first month of the programme. [cite: 232]

[cite_start]**2.2.** There will be 8 core courses which contribute to 32 credits of the programme. [cite: 233] [cite_start]The number of credits allocated to core and elective courses is equal to the number of contact hours every week including tutorial sessions in that particular course. [cite: 234]

[cite_start]**2.3.** The elective courses for the third and fourth semesters offered at KSOM are listed in subsection 4.3. [cite: 235] [cite_start]All the courses listed there may, however, not be offered in an academic year. [cite: 236] [cite_start]The list of courses offered every year will be announced at the beginning of the third semester. [cite: 237] [cite_start]Elective courses in the third semester will be categorized into blocks: Algebra block, Analysis block, and Geometry block. [cite: 238] [cite_start]Every student is recommended to credit at least one course from each block. [cite: 239] [cite_start]Elective-4 in the third semester is expected to be a first step towards the project/reading course in the final semester. [cite: 240]

[cite_start]**2.4.** Every student has the option to work on a project or a reading course in the fourth semester. [cite: 241] [cite_start]The project will comprise a dissertation and Viva at the end of the fourth semester. [cite: 242] [cite_start]The project will carry 8 credits. [cite: 243] [cite_start]Every student has the option of taking an elective and a reading course of 4 credits in the fourth semester, instead of a project. [cite: 243] [cite_start]The reading course involves the study of an advanced topic or a research paper, along with a colloquium at the end of the programme. [cite: 244]

**2.5.** A student may continue into the PhD programme subject to the the following conditions:
[cite_start](1) The student has acquired 76 credits at the end the fourth semester. [cite: 246]
[cite_start](2) The CGPA of the student is at least 8(in case of SC/ST candidates the cut-off shall be 7). [cite: 247]
[cite_start](3) The student has not obtained a grade of B or C in more than four courses during the MSc coursework. [cite: 248]

[cite_start]**2.6.** The admission to the PhD component will be limited based on the availability of the research supervisors. [cite: 248]

[cite_start]**2.7.** The course structure for the MSc is listed below. [cite: 249] [cite_start]The detailed syllabi for the courses offered at KSOM are listed in subsections 4.2 and 4.3. [cite: 249]

[cite_start]**2.8.** The course structure for the first year of the programme is summarized below. [cite: 250]

[cite_start]Every student has to either select (*) or (**) in their final semester. [cite: 253] [cite_start]The project carries 8 credits, and all other courses, including the reading course carry 4 credits. [cite: 254]

### 3. EVALUATION AND PROMOTION

[cite_start]**3.1.** Evaluation scheme for the core and elective courses offered at KSOM will contain two components: Continuous Assessment and End-semester Examination. [cite: 255] [cite_start]The weightage of continuous assessment and end-semester examination in any course offered at KSOM will be as given below. [cite: 256]

| | Core Course | Elective course |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Continuous Assessment** | 50% | 40%-60% |
| **End-Semester Examination** | 50% | 40%-60% |
[cite_start][cite: 257]

[cite_start]The weightage allotted to continuous assessment and end semester examination in an elective course will be declared at the beginning of the course by the instructor(s). [cite: 258]

[cite_start]**3.2.** Evaluation will be based on seven letter grades (O, A+, A, B+, B, C and F) with numerical values (grade points) of 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5 and 0 respectively. [cite: 259] [cite_start]In addition to the above, an incomplete grade given by I and an absent grade given by Ab will also be used. [cite: 260, 261] [cite_start]The grading scheme involved in any course at KSOM is absolute. [cite: 262]

[cite_start]**3.3.** The continuous assessment for the courses offered at KSOM will be based on a predetermined transparent system involving the following components : [cite: 263]

| | Core Course | Elective course |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mid-semester examinations** | 20%-30% | 20%-30% |
| **Periodic written tests** | 0%-20% | 0%-20% |
| **Assignments** | 10%-30% | 10%-30% |
| **Seminars or other components** | | 0%-20% |
[cite_start][cite: 264]

[cite_start]The transparent system will be declared at the beginning of the course by the instructor(s). [cite: 265] [cite_start]The end-semester examinations for every course will be conducted and evaluated by the instructor(s) of the course. [cite: 266]

**3.4. [cite_start]Promotion policy.** The grades are divided in to the following categories. [cite: 267]

| Grade | Grade Points | Marks range | Merit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| O | 10 | 90-100 | Outstanding |
| A+ | 9 | 80-89.99 | Very good |
| A | 8 | 70-79.99 | Good |
| B+ | 7 | 60-69.99 | Above average |
| B | 6 | 55-59.99 | Average |
| C | 5 | 50-54.99 | Pass |
| F | 0 | Below 50 | Fail |
| I | 0 | | Incomplete |
| Ab | 0 | | Absent |
[cite_start][cite: 268]

[cite_start]**3.5.** A student securing the grade 'F' in the respective course will be treated as having failed in the course. [cite: 269] [cite_start]In such a scenario an option of a make-up examination will be provided. [cite: 270] [cite_start]The make-up examination will be held in the week before the beginning of the next semester. [cite: 271] The Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) out of 10 is calculated as per the following formula
$$
CGPA = \frac{\sum_{\text{Courses taken in the programme}} (\text{No. of credits of the course} \times \text{Grade Points})}{\text{Net total number of credits obtained in the core and elective courses}}
$$
[cite_start]Courses taken in the programme does not include bridge courses. [cite: 272] [cite_start]A semester grade point average (SGPA) is calculated similarly every semester. [cite: 273]

[cite_start]**3.6.** A student who has obtained 76 credits at the end of the second year, irrespective of satisfying the eligibility criterion for promotion into PhD, will be given an MSc degree. [cite: 274]

[cite_start]**3.7.** The maximum time for completion of the MSc is 4 years during which 76 credits should be acquired. [cite: 275] [cite_start]A student needs to acquire a minimum of 20 credits (excluding Viva) to get promoted to the second year of the programme. [cite: 276] [cite_start]Any student unable to do so in the first two years will be asked to discontinue the MSc. programme. [cite: 277]
