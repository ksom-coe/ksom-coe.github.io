        <h3>1.1. Kerala School of Mathematics</h3>
        <p>Kerala School of Mathematics (KSOM) - a joint initiative of the Kerala State Council for Science, Technology and Environment, Government of Kerala and the Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India - is a national institute for advanced research in Mathematics. KSOM was founded with the vision of establishing a centre of excellence for research in Mathematics. The institute is a meeting ground for leading mathematicians from across the world and a centre of advanced learning in Mathematics in the state of Kerala.</p>

        <h3>1.2. The programme</h3>
        <p>The Integrated MSc-PhD programme in Mathematics at KSOM is an advanced training program at the postgraduate level leading to doctoral studies. The coursework is very flexible with a focus on grooming students for a research career in Mathematics. Depending on the choice of the electives, a student also has the option to choose a research career in Physics or Theoretical Computer Science as well. The curriculum is among the best that is available in the country at the postgraduate level. The Board of Studies for the Integrated MSc-PhD programme of KSOM will supervise the programme.</p>

        <h3>1.3. Duration of the programme</h3>
        <p>The duration of the integrated programme will be 5 years. This includes 2 years of MSc coursework and 3 years of PhD coursework and research. The students are expected to complete the programme within 7 years.</p>

        <h3>1.4. Intake</h3>
        <p>The number of students admitted to the programme will be 10.</p>

        <h3>1.5. Eligibility</h3>
        <p>
          Candidates with a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics or an allied subject with at least 60% marks or equivalent grade from a recognized university are eligible to apply.
        </p>

        <h3>1.6. Admission Procedure</h3>
        <p>
          Admission will be based on a written test followed by an interview.

      <div class="accordion-content">
        <h3>2.1. Credits</h3>
        <p>A total of 76 credits in two years is required to obtain the MSc. degree. Every student has to take the three bridge courses before the commencement of the first semester. The purpose of these bridge courses is to review the fundamentals from a typical undergraduate mathematics programme and to bridge any gaps in the foundations. The bridge course will be undertaken in the first month of the programme.</p>

        <h3>2.2. Core Courses (MSc)</h3>
        <p>There will be 8 core courses which contribute to 32 credits of the programme. The number of credits allocated to core and elective courses is equal to the number of contact hours every week including tutorial sessions in that particular course.</p>

        <h3>2.3. Elective Courses (MSc)</h3>
        <p>The elective courses for the third and fourth semesters offered at KSoM are listed in subsection 4.3. All the courses listed there may, however, not be offered in an academic year. The list of courses offered every year will be announced at the beginning of the third semester. Elective courses in the third semester will be categorized into blocks: Algebra block, Analysis block, and Geometry block. Every student is recommended to credit at least one course from each block. Elective-4 in the third semester is expected to be a first step towards the project/reading course in the final semester.</p>

        <h3>2.4. Research Project (MSc)</h3>
        <p>Every student has the option to work on a project or a reading course in the fourth semester. The project will comprise a dissertation and Viva at the end of the fourth semester. The project will carry 8 credits. Every student has the option of taking an elective and a reading course of 4 credits in the fourth semester, instead of a project. The reading course involves the study of an advanced topic or a research paper, along with a colloquium at the end of the programme.</p>

        <h3>2.5. Promotion to PhD Component</h3>
        <p>A student may continue into the PhD programme subject to the the following conditions:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The student has acquired 76 credits at the end the fourth semester.</li>
          <li>The CGPA of the student is at least 8 (in case of SC/ST candidates the cut-off shall be 7).</li>
          <li>The student has not obtained a grade of B or C in more than four courses during the MSc coursework.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>2.6. PhD Admission Limitations</h3>
        <p>The admission to the PhD component will be limited based on the availability of the research supervisors.</p>

        <h3>2.7. MSc Course Structure Summary</h3>

        <h3>3.3. Promotion to PhD Component</h3>
        <p>The promotion of a student to the PhD component is subject to satisfying all conditions listed in 2.5, and on joining a research supervisor at the end of the second year. Students must maintain a minimum CGPA of 7.0 (out of 10.0) in the MSc component to be eligible for promotion.</p>

        <h3>3.4. Doctoral Committee</h3>
        <p>A doctoral committee will be constituted for each student on promotion to the PhD component. The doctoral committee will consist of the supervisor, two faculty members from KSOM, and one external expert. The committee will meet at least once a year to review the student's progress.</p>

        <h3>3.5. Withdrawal from the programme</h3>
        <p>A student may opt for an MSc degree and exit the programme after successfully completing the MSc coursework and fulfilling the requirements for the MSc degree. A student who opts for an MSc degree and exits the programme cannot rejoin the PhD programme.</p>

        <h3>3.6. Termination from the programme</h3>
        <p>A student may be terminated from the programme if he/she fails to maintain the minimum CGPA criterion or if the doctoral committee finds the progress of the student unsatisfactory.</p>

        <h3>5.1. Eligibility and Constitution of Doctoral Committee</h3>
        <p>The promotion of a student to the PhD component is subject to satisfying all conditions listed in 2.5, and on joining a research supervisor at the end of the second year. A doctoral committee will be constituted for each student on promotion to the PhD component. The doctoral committee will conduct the Oral General Comprehensive Examination (OGCE) in the fourth year of the student. The syllabus for the OGCE (four advanced courses in the area of specialization) will be designed by the research supervisor and approved by the doctoral committee.</p>

        <h3>5.2. Senior Research Fellowship</h3>
        <p>A student is promoted to Senior Research Fellowship on clearing the OGCE.</p>

        <h3>5.3. Progress Monitoring</h3>
        <p>The doctoral committee will monitor the yearly progress of the respective student at the end of each year thereafter.</p>
