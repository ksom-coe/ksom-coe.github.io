            The research in Complex Analysis and Geometry at KSoM delves into the intricate relationships between complex analysis, geometry, and topology. A significant focus is on the theory of several complex variables, particularly the applications and implications of $L^2$-estimates for the $\bar{\partial}$-operator, such as Hörmander's estimates. These estimates are crucial for understanding the existence and properties of holomorphic functions on complex manifolds.
        </p>
        <p>
            We investigate their impact on the Bers domain (Teichmüller space), exploring how these analytical tools can shed light on the geometry and deformation theory of Riemann surfaces. A key area of inquiry is examining when the Kobayashi metric—an intrinsic pseudometric on a complex manifold—becomes isometric to the Teichmüller metric, revealing profound geometric insights. This research bridges classical complex analysis with modern Teichmüller theory and differential geometry, fostering interdisciplinary connections with algebraic geometry and partial differential equations.

            The Braid Groups and Mapping Class Groups research at KSoM focuses on understanding these fundamental algebraic structures that arise in various branches of mathematics, particularly in low-dimensional topology and geometric group theory. Our work explores the intricate relationships between braid groups (which describe the ways strands can be braided) and mapping class groups of surfaces (which describe the ways surfaces can be deformed).
        </p>
        <p>
            A central theme is the investigation of liftability problems and the Birman-Hilden property, which determine when surface homeomorphisms can be "lifted" to corresponding mappings on covering spaces or higher-dimensional manifolds, particularly handlebodies. This has deep implications for understanding the structure of knots and links. Additionally, we are keenly interested in classifying unitary representations of braid groups and analyzing their connections to quantum invariants, forging links between geometric group theory, representation theory, and the emerging field of quantum topology.

            The Harmonic Analysis group at KSoM conducts research at the interface of classical Fourier analysis, operator theory, and the geometry of Lie groups. Our primary investigations revolve around harmonic analysis on nilpotent Lie groups, which provide a rich non-commutative setting for generalizing classical Fourier analysis. We also explore modern time-frequency methods, which are crucial for analyzing signals and functions across both time and frequency domains.

            Specific areas of interest include the study of modulation spaces, Fourier multipliers, twisted convolution operators, and their $L^p$-$L^q$ boundedness properties. We analyze nonlinear Schrödinger equations involving twisted Laplacians, maximal functions along hypersurfaces, and develops Hardy-Sobolev inequalities in non-commutative settings, advancing oscillatory integral techniques for dispersive partial differential equations.

            In Non-commutative Functional Analysis, our research extends classical functional analysis concepts to the realm of quantum mechanics and quantum information theory. We primarily focus on the theory of operator algebras (like C*-algebras and von Neumann algebras) and operator spaces, which provide the mathematical framework for quantum systems.
        </p>

            Key research areas involve investigating quantum approximation properties, which deal with how well quantum states or operators can be approximated by simpler ones. We also study concepts of convexity in C*-algebras, matricial ranges, and the structure of operator systems. This work bridges abstract functional analysis with concrete problems in quantum information, leading to applications in quantum error correction, the classification of quantum channels, and the geometric analysis of quantum states.
