                <div class="accordion-snippet">
                    Our group explores several complex variables as a dynamic area of modern mathematics, focusing on Hörmander's estimates and their impact on the Bers domain (Teichmüller space). We investigate the profound geometric implications of the Kobayashi metric being isometric to the Teichmüller metric.<span class="snippet-more-indicator"> ...more</span>

                <div class="accordion-snippet">
                    We study fundamental structures at the intersection of algebraic topology and geometric group theory, examining relationships between braid groups and mapping class groups. Our work centers on liftability problems and the Birman-Hilden property, which determine when surface homeomorphisms extend to handlebodies.<span class="snippet-more-indicator"> ...more</span>

                <div class="accordion-snippet">
                    Our investigations center on harmonic analysis in nilpotent Lie groups and time-frequency methods, connecting classical Fourier analysis with modern operator theory. We explore modulation spaces, Fourier multipliers, twisted convolution operators, and their Lp-Lq boundedness properties.<span class="snippet-more-indicator"> ...more</span>

                <div class="accordion-snippet">
                    We extend functional analysis to quantum realms through operator algebras and operator spaces, investigating quantum approximation properties and convexity in C*-algebras. Our work focuses on completely bounded approximation, quantum convexity, matricial ranges, and operator system structures.<span class="snippet-more-indicator"> ...more</span>
