                <li>An exit policy in the program allows students to leave the program with an MSc degree after two years of the program if they so desire.</li>
                <li>Subsidised on-campus accommodation is offered to all selected candidates.</li>
                <li>Students will have free access to the institute facilities such as library, and other online resources related to their study.</li>
