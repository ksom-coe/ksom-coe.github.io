        <div class="modal-research-cards-container">
            <a href="https://ksom.res.in/research/complex-analysis" class="modal-research-card">
                <h3>Complex Analysis Research</h3>
                <p>Our group explores several complex variables as a dynamic area of modern mathematics, focusing on Hörmander's estimates and their impact on the Bers domain (Teichmüller space). We investigate the profound geometric implications of the Kobayashi metric being isometric to the Teichmüller metric. This research bridges complex analysis, Teichmüller theory, and differential geometry, advancing our understanding of intrinsic metrics on complex spaces through interdisciplinary connections with algebra, PDEs, and algebraic geometry.</p>
            </a>
            <a href="https://ksom.res.in/research/braid-&-mapping-class-groups" class="modal-research-card">
                <h3>Braid Groups & Mapping Class Groups Research</h3>
                <p>We study fundamental structures at the intersection of algebraic topology and geometric group theory, examining relationships between braid groups and mapping class groups. Our work centers on liftability problems and the Birman-Hilden property, which determine when surface homeomorphisms extend to handlebodies. A key focus involves classifying unitary representations of braid groups and analyzing their connections to quantum invariants, linking geometric group theory with representation theory and quantum topology.</p>
            </a>
            <a href="https://ksom.res.in/research/harmonic-analysis" class="modal-research-card">
                <h3>Harmonic Analysis Research</h3>
                <p>Our investigations center on harmonic analysis in nilpotent Lie groups and time-frequency methods, connecting classical Fourier analysis with modern operator theory. We explore modulation spaces, Fourier multipliers, twisted convolution operators, and their Lp-Lq boundedness properties. The group also analyzes nonlinear Schrödinger equations with twisted Laplacians, maximal functions along hypersurfaces, and develops Hardy-Sobolev inequalities in non-commutative settings, advancing oscillatory integral techniques for dispersive PDEs.</p>
            </a>
            <a href="https://ksom.res.in/research/non-commutative-functional-analysis" class="modal-research-card">
                <h3>Non-commutative Functional Analysis Research</h3>
                <p>We extend functional analysis to quantum realms through operator algebras and operator spaces, investigating quantum approximation properties and convexity in C*-algebras. Our work focuses on completely bounded approximation, quantum convexity, matricial ranges, and operator system structures. This research bridges abstract functional analysis with quantum information theory, with applications in quantum error correction, quantum channel classification, and geometric analysis of quantum states.</p>
                </a>
                <a href="https://ksom.res.in/research/analytic-number-theory" class="modal-research-card">
                    <h3>Analytic Number Theory Research</h3>
                    <p>Our group employs advanced analytic techniques to study prime distributions, multiplicative functions, and L-function special values. We investigate multiple zeta values and their generalizations (including multiple Apéry-like sums), explicit averages beyond classical estimates, Möbius sums with coprimality conditions, and additive number theory extensions. Key work involves the Beurling-Selberg function's applications to prime number theory and developing new methods for bounding multiple zeta value tails, connecting analytic techniques with combinatorial structures.</p>
                </a>
            </div>
